    <p>A cyber-physical system (CPS) refers to the combination of computer-aided, software components with mechanical and electronic parts, which can be accessed via a data infrastructure, such as data centers where the Internet communicates. With the advancement of information technology in the big data and AI era, novel software in CPS emerges. While such software using machine learning helps develop novel applications in the CPS, it also brings challenges and safety and concerns, especially in software safety, reliability and security. There have already been reports on attacks using machine learning on such new software resulting in CPS crash, data leakage, and property loss. The problem will be even more severe if the software is deployed in a safety-critical system.</p>
    <p>To address this problem, there will be a workshop at ISSRE 2022. We welcome original work in methods and technologies that make novel theoretical or practical contributions to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of software using machine learning in CPS.</p>
    <p>Topics of interest include development, analysis methods, technologies, and machine learning models to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of software in CPS, and are not limited to:</p>
        1. Reliability, Security, and Safety of Software in CPS
        <br/>2.	Deep Learning for Program Synthesis
        <br/>3.	Inroads in Testing Access Control Using Deep Learning
        <br/>4.	Vulnerability Management
